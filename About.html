  <section>
    <h2 class="scan-sweep">About Me</h2>
    <p>My journey into tech began not in a classroom, but with a secondhand computer that barely worked. It ran hot, crashed constantly, and forced me to learn how computers operate from the inside out. That broken machine lit a fire in me — a curiosity about technology that never faded. Over the years, that curiosity sharpened into a passion for cybersecurity, data science, and building software that solves meaningful problems.</p>

    <p>Today, I'm a Computer Science major at <strong>Harvey Mudd College</strong>, where I study systems, software, and security with intensity and heart. I've had the opportunity to lead high-impact research, build machine learning models, develop brain-computer interface systems, and serve in multiple leadership roles — including Dorm President, CS Mentorship Director, and founder of student organizations. I'm currently an <strong>AI Researcher at the Harvey Mudd College APE Lab</strong>, where I study AI and it's applications in environmental science and cybersecurity — a perfect blend of my passions for defense and innovation.</p>

    <p>I'm the kind of builder who thrives at the intersection of mission and engineering. Whether it's deploying secure infrastructure, visualizing intelligence data, or mentoring future technologists, I care deeply about both the code and the cause. If my work can support national defense, uplift communities, or protect information — then I'm on the right path.</p>

    <p>Outside of tech, I find peace in faith, intensity in lifting, and joy in racing games and cooking. My heritage is Indian and I'm a first-generation American, driven to succeed not for the resume, but for my family and future.</p>
